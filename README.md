# Cpp-practice
Some programming practice on C++, trying to get back in the mix!


I think that my code (cpp1.cpp) is technically correct and the problem is being caused because of the godamn compiler. Apparently no
two C++ compilers are really alike and depending on which one you're using, you might wanna make some changes so some or
the other aspect of your code. This means C++ is just a bad language to use to get back into the programming mix. I think
that I should focus on Python, JS, PHP et al. 

C++ is just too much unnecessary bullshit to keep in mind. It's especially bullshit because I have no intention of using C++ in anything that I'm currently interested in being able to do (full stack web + react native Android).
